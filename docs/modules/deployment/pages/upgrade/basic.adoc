= Basic Upgrade Steps

This procedure describes how to do a basic {page-component-title} upgrade.
You may need to complete additional steps to upgrade in a more complex setup (running more than one OpenNMS instance, database migration requirements, age of current version, and so on).

IMPORTANT: Make sure you complete the tasks in the xref:deployment:upgrade/introduction.adoc#byb_upgrade[before you begin] section before upgrade.
In addition, if xref:releasenotes:whatsnew.adoc[system requirements] in the new version require you to upgrade your PostgreSQL database, we recommend you do this before the {page-component-title} upgrade.

== Update and verify the {page-component-title} repository
