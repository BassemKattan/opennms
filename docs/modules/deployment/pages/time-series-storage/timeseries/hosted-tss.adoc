= Hosted Time Series Service

The hosted time series service provides a cloud-hosted time series database to store performance metrics that {page-component-title} collects from the devices it monitors.

In addition, users can view time series summary data including health status, capacity, and metrics per second in the #OpenNMS Portal#.

== Requirements

Make sure you have the following before you start to use hosted time series service:

* Horizon 31+ (Meridian availability with the 2023 release)
* Access to the xref:https://portal.opennms.com[OpenNMS Portal] to retrieve your API key and view hosted time series service metrics

Contact sales@opennms.com to sign up for hosted time series service.

== Deployment

There are three phases of deployment to set up the hosted time series service for your system:

* Configure the Cloud Connectivity plugin
* Obtain a license key for the service
* Enable cloud services

=== Configure the Cloud Connectivity plugin

The Cloud Connectivity plugin makes it possible for a {page-component-title} instance to send time series data to an OpenNMS-hosted cloud service.

The Cloud Connectivity plugin is installed by default in {page-component-title} 31.
However, you need to move the configuration files into the correct location and restart {page-component-title}:

[source, console]
----
cp /opt/opennms/etc/examples/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties /opt/opennms/etc/opennms.properties.d/timeseries.properties

systemctl restart openmns
----

=== Obtain a license key for the hosted time series service

The license key enables the hosted time series service in {page-component-title}.

You must log in to the OpenNMS Portal to get this license key, copy it, and then paste it into the appropriate screen in {page-component-title}.

You should have received an activation email from OpenNMS with a login for the OpenNMS Portal.

To obtain the license key, follow these steps:

. If you have not already done so, activate your OpenNMS Portal account by clicking the *Account Activation* button in your welcome email.
. On the Create Your OpenNMS Account screen, type a password in the Password box.
. Click *Create My Account*.
. Sign in to the OpenNMS Portal with your username and password.
. Choose *OpenNMS Core Instances* in the left menu and click *Add New*.
. Type in the name of your instance and click *Get Instance Key*.
. Copy the instance key and click *Save & Close*.

+
NOTE: The key is valid for one hour.
If you do not use it within that time, you must log back into the OpenNMS Portal and copy it from your instance.

. Log in to the OpenNMS web UI for your instance.
. Click *UI Preview*.
. In the left menu, click *Time Series*.
. Turn hosted time series on.
. Paste the key in the ?? field and click *Save*.

By default, collectd collects data every five minutes.
You should see time series summary information in the OpenNMS Portal UI within 15 minutes.
For more information on how to view this information, see #View Time Series Summary Data# in the OpenNMS Portal documentation.
To change the data collection frequency, see #XXX#.
