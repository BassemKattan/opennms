= File Editor

The File Editor page, available in the new web UI, lets you view and edit configuration files (`.xml`, `.cfg`, `.drl`, and so on) in the {page-component-title} UI instead of having to edit them in your local file system (for example, by locating the file in your `/etc` directory and editing it with a text editor).
To access the file editor, log in to the web UI and click menu:Info[File Editor] in the top menu bar.

NOTE: Making changes to configuration files will affect the operation of {page-component-title}.
Incorrectly editing a file could result in features no longer working, or not working as intended.

== View files

By default, the File Editor page displays a tree view of your OpenNMS `/etc` directory.
From this page, you can do the following:

* Navigate to and open any file in your OpenNMS directory.
* Expand and collapse subtrees (subdirectories).
* Search for a directory name.
* Search for any part of a file.
* View and edit files.

== Edit files

To edit a file, open it on the File Editor page and type in the text box that is displayed.
Click *Save* to save your changes and update the configuration file.

CAUTION: Making changes to configuration files on the File Editor page will overwrite the file on your disk; there is currently no versioning or support for backup files.

Click *Reset* to reload the file from your local disk into the editor.

NOTE: Reloading the file will display it as it was last saved to your disk, not necessarily the file from before you edited it.

== Add and delete files

To add a new file to your OpenNMS directory, navigate to a subdirectory and click *Add* (*+*).
Type a name for the file, enter some text in the *Edit* box, and click *Save*.

Note that validation will run on the file when you attempt to save it, and may prevent it from being saved.
If an error is encountered, a message at the bottom of the text editor will provide more information on why validation failed.

To delete a file from your directory, navigate to a subdirectory, find the file that you want to delete, and click the *Minus* symbol (*-*) beside its name.
Click *Confirm* in the dialog that appears to confirm deletion.

CAUTION: Deleting a file is permanent.
The file is removed from your local disk and is unrecoverable.

== The console

A console box is displayed at the bottom of the *Edit* box.
It displays detailed information after your perform certain actions (for example, saving or deleting a file).
To clear the console of text, click *Clear*.
To hide the console box, click *Minimize*.

== Activate configuration changes

Depending on which file is edited, {page-component-title} may detect and apply the configuration changes automatically.
In other cases, your instance may need to be restarted.

The following docs provide more information on configuration files:
