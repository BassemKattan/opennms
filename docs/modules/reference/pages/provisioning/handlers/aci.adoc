= ACI Handler

The ACI handler imports a requisition generated by the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-aci-plugin[OpenMMS ACI plugin].
The OpenNMS ACI plugin enables OpenNMS to monitor devices and networks that Cisco APIC controllers manage and import inventory from the operational topology.

The format of the URL for this protocol handler is: `requisition://aci`

This URL invokes the ACI plugin with default settings.
For more information on ACI query parameters, see the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-aci-plugin/blob/master/README.md[ACI plugin readme file] and associated documentation in the repository.
