= OpenDaylight Handler

The OpenDaylight handler imports a requisition generated by the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-opendaylight-plugin[OpenNMS OpenDaylight plugin].
The plugin enables OpenNMS to monitor devices and networks that OpenDaylight controllers manage and import inventory from the operational topology.

The format of the URL for this protocol handler is: `requisition://opendaylight`

This URL invokes the OpenDaylight plugin with default settings.
For more information on OpenDaylight query parameters, see the https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms-opendaylight-plugin/blob/master/README.md[OpenDaylight plugin readme file] and associated documentation in the repository.
