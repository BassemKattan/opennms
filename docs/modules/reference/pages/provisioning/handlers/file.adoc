= File Handler

The file handler imports a properly-formatted requisition definition from an XML file stored locally on the server.

== Configure file requisition

ifeval::["{page-component-title}" == "Horizon"]
Prior to {page-component-title} 30, you set requisition definitions in the `provisiond-configuration.xml` file.
This file is no longer available.
You must use the UI to configure a requisition definition.
endif::[]

To configure a file requisition, follow the steps in xref:reference:provisioning/handlers/introduction.adoc#create-req-def[Create a requisition definition], but specify File as the type, and set the path, schedule, and rescan behavior.

file:///path/to/my/requisition.xml
