= Requisition Plugins

{page-component-title} provides plugins that can provision nodes from additional platforms, including software-defined networking, hypervisor, and configuration management database (CMDB) platforms.

Each of these plugins has a handler that invokes the plugin with default settings.
Some plugins accept options in the form of query parameters, which shape the requisitions generated by that plugin and imported by Provisiond.
