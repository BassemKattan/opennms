| Term
| Definition
2+|*A*
| ActiveMQ
| Java-based open-source message broker supported by the Apache community.

| ALEC
| The Architecture for Learning Enabled Correlation (ALEC) is an OpenNMS framework that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide alarm triage.
ALEC groups related alarms so you can better manage the more complex situations they might represent.

| Application Perspective Monitoring (APM)
| A method that uses the Minion infrastructure to monitor a serviceâ€™s availability from different perspectives to help identify if nodes are down for everyone or if an outage affects only certain sites. When a service is not responsive an outage will be generated with the corresponding perspective that sees the outage.
2+|*C*
| Cassandra
| Open-source distributed/scale-out NoSQL database designed to hold large amounts of structured or unstructured data across many servers.
2+|*D*
| Discovery
| A process that uses ICMP to find network devices and services in your network and then automatically adds them to monitoring.

|Dominion
| The service on an OpenNMS core that controls the operation of Minions.
2+|*E*
| Elasticsearch
| Elasticsearch is a search engine based on the Lucene library. OpenNMS persists/forwards certain data to Elasticsearch to store flow records and warehouse events and alarm history for long-term storage of this data.
2+|*H*
| Helm
| Helm is an an OpenNMS application for creating flexible dashboards to display and customize fault management and performance management data from Horizon and Meridian.
Helm works with the Grafana analytics program to customize the data you can view.
| Horizon
| Open-source solution from OpenNMS that helps users visualize and monitor everything on their local and remote networks.
Free, community-driven project includes the latest technology and features delivered through a rapid release cycle.
2+|*I*
| IFTTT
| If This Then That (https://ifttt.com/[IFTTT]) service integrates apps, devices, and services. Horizon and Meridian can integrate with IFTTT to trigger actions on other services based on customized alarms.
2+|*K*
| Kafka
| Clusterable, open-source message broker designed for high-throughput/low-latency event streaming originally developed at LinkedIn, now supported by the Apache community.

|KSC Reports
| Key SNMP customized (KSC) reports provide a way to generate prefabricated graphical views of collected data. They let you display data from different devices and sources (SNMP, ICMP, HTTP) on one page.
2+|*M*
| Meridian
|Subscription-based, optimized, and stable version of the OpenNMS Horizon platform.
Annual release with monthly security patches that includes only the most stable and secure Horizon features.

| Minion
| Instance of the Karaf OSGi service that enables OpenNMS to monitor devices and services in locations that OpenNMS cannot reach.
Minions communicate with these remote devices while OpenNMS performs coordination and task delegation.
2+|*N*
| Nephron
| OpenNMS component that enables streaming analytics for flows.
| Newts
| Newts (New-Fangled Time Series Datastore) is an OpenNMS time series data store based on Apache Cassandra.
Use it as an alternative persistence strategy instead of JRobin or RRDtool.
2+|*O*
| Okta
| Identity-as-a-service provider to identify and authenticate users.
Used with Minion Appliance.
2+|*P*
| PostgreSQL
| Commonly used open-source relational database known for its stability.
PostgreSQL scales up but not out.
| Provisioning
| The process of getting your devices, applications, and services into monitoring.
2+|*R*
| Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
| Java API that lets one Java Virtual Machine (JVM) running object to invoke methods on an object running in another JVM. RMI integration lets you access Horizon/Meridian through jconsole or remote manage them.
| Round Robin Database (RRD)
| Special type of database designed for collection, visualization, and analysis of time-series data.
Data is maintained as a fixed-size circular-buffer that overwrites the oldest data with new data.
2+|*S*
| Sentinel
| Karaf container that provides scalability for data processing, including flows, SNMP traps, syslog messages, and streaming telemetry in OpenNMS.
It also supports thresholding for streaming telemetry if you are using OpenNMS Newts.
2+|*T*
| Time series, time-series database (TSDB)
| Time series is a sequence of data points that occur in successive order over a period of time.
A time series database (TSDB) is designed to store and serve time series data. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database[time series database].)
