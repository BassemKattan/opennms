= Foreign Source Definition

The default foreign source definition serves as a template that defines the services to detect on (DNS, FTP, ICMP, and so on), the scan interval for discovery, and the policies to use when provisioning.

Policies determine entity persistence and/or set attributes on the discovered entities that control {page-component-title} management behavior.
Provisiond applies the existing default foreign source definition unless you choose to modify it.

This section describes how to edit the default foreign source definition.

== Edit detectors and set scan interval

. In the web UI, click the gear icon in the top right.
. In the *Provisioning* area, choose *Manage Provisioning Requisitions*.
. Click *Edit Default FS*.

NOTE: The screen displays the list of service detectors and a tab to view and define policies.
Provisiond scans the services in the order in which the detectors appear in the list.

. Click the appropriate icon to edit, delete, or move a service detector.
.. You can also add parameters to a detector, including retries, timeout, port, and so on, by clicking the Edit icon and choosing *Add Parameter*.
. Click *Save*.
. If desired, update the scan interval using one of the following:

+
* w: weeks
* d: days
* h: hours
* m: minutes
* s: seconds
* ms: milliseconds

+
For example, to rescan every six days and 53 minutes, use `6d 53m`.
Specify `0` to disable automatic scanning.

. Click *Save*.

== Create policies

. Click the *Policies* tab in the *Default Foreign Source Definition* screen.
. Specify a name for the policy, select the class from the drop down, and fill out any information associated with that class.
.. Use the space bar to see the options for the fields.
. (optional) Click *Add Parameter* to add additional parameters to the class, or *Save*.
. Click *Save*.
. Repeat for any additional policies you want to add.
. Click *Save* at the top right to save the FS definition.

NOTE: To return to the default foreign source definition, click *Reset to Default*.
