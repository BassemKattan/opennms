= Beyond Quick Start

The <quick-start/inventory.adoc, Provision Inventory>> in the quick start section provides an overview of provisioning and basic procedures to start provisioning using the default configuration.

This section includes procedures on how to update 

* <<quick-start/inventory.adoc#provision-snmp-configuration, configure SNMP for provisioning>> hange the default SNMP configuration parameters.

{page-component-title} installs with a base configuration that automatically begins service-level monitoring and reporting as soon as you provision managed entities (nodes, IP interfaces, SNMP interfaces, and services).

{page-component-title} has three methods of provisioning:

* xref:deep-dive/provisioning/auto-discovery.adoc[]
* xref:deep-dive/provisioning/directed-discovery.adoc[]
* xref:development:rest/rest-api.adoc#rest-api[asset import] through the RestAPI

Use auto discovery if you do not have a "source of truth" for your network inventory.
Auto discovery can become that source.
Be aware that auto discovery can include entities you do not want to monitor, if not properly configured.

Directed discovery is effective if you know your inventory, particularly with smaller networks (for example, 100â€“200 nodes).
It is also useful for areas of your network that you cannot auto discover.

Regardless of the method, provisioning is an iterative process.
You will need to fine-tune your results to exclude or add things to what you monitor.

== Before you begin



== Beyond the quick start

Follow the steps in <<quick-start/inventory.adoc#provision-snmp-configuration, configure SNMP for provisioning>> to change the default SNMP configuration parameters.

In addition, you may want to xref:foreign-source-definition[edit the default foreign source definition] to specify the services to detect and policies to apply during discovery, beyond the default values in the quick start.

[[foreign-source-definition]]
== Edit Default Foreign Source Definition

The default foreign source definition serves as a template that defines the services to detect on (DNS, FTP, ICMP, and so on), the scan interval for discovery, and the policies to use when provisioning.

Policies determine entity persistence and/or set attributes on the discovered entities that control {page-component-title} management behavior.
Provisiond applies the existing default foreign source definition unless you choose to modify it.

=== Edit detectors and set scan interval

. In the web UI, click the gear icon in the top right.
. In the *Provisioning* area, choose *Manage Provisioning Requisitions*.
. Click *Edit Default FS*.

+

NOTE: The screen displays the list of service detectors and a tab to view and define policies.
Provisiond scans the services in the order in which the detectors appear in the list.

. Click the appropriate icon to edit, delete, or move a service detector.
.. You can also add parameters to a detector, including retries, timeout, port, and so on, by clicking the Edit icon and choosing *Add Parameter*.
. Click *Save*.
. If desired, update the scan interval using one of the following:

+

* w: weeks
* d: days
* h: hours
* m: minutes
* s: seconds
* ms: milliseconds

+

For example, to rescan every six days and 53 minutes, use `6d 53m`.
Specify `0` to disable automatic scanning.

. Click *Save*.

=== Create policies

. Click the *Policies* tab in the *Default Foreign Source Definition* screen.
. Specify a name for the policy, select the class from the drop down, and fill out any information associated with that class.
.. Use the space bar to see the options for the fields.
. (optional) Click *Add Parameter* to add additional parameters to the class, or *Save*.
. Click *Save*.
. Repeat for any additional policies you want to add.
. Click *Save* at the top right to save the FS definition.

NOTE: To return to the default foreign source definition, click *Reset to Default*.
