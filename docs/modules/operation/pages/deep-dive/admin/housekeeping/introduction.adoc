= Housekeeping Tasks

There are a number of housekeeping tasks that you may want to do regularly to ensure optimum system performance.
We also recommend you complete some of these housekeeping tasks before upgrading {page-component-title}.

== Prior to upgrading

[[prune-events]]
=== Prune unneeded events

Use vacuumd or cron to regularly prune unneeded events.
This helps to clean up your events table, and reduces the amount of data in your backups.
We also recommend doing this before you begin the {page-component-title} upgrade process.

For example, run the following code to delete events older than six weeks that have no associated outages:

[source, sql]
----
--# this deletes any events that are not associated with outages
DELETE FROM events WHERE NOT EXISTS
(SELECT svclosteventid FROM outages WHERE svclosteventid = events.eventid
UNION
SELECT svcregainedeventid FROM outages WHERE svcregainedeventid = events.eventid
UNION
SELECT eventid FROM notifications WHERE eventid = events.eventid)
AND eventtime < now() - interval '6 weeks';
----

== After upgrading

=== Troubleshooting

If your {page-component-title} instance fails to start after upgrading, you can run the Fix Karaf script to delete cached items.
The script tries to fix configuration problems by pruning `/opt/opennms/data` and restoring all Karaf-related configuration files to a pristine state.

[source, console]
/opt/opennms/bin/fix-karaf-setup.sh

IMPORTANT: The Fix Karaf script can be destructive to files that may contain user-specific configuration settings.

[[ga-data-collection]]
== Data collection

When enabled, the `Data Choices` module collects anonymous use statistics.
It publishes them on system startup and every 24 hours after.
Usage statistics include the following data points:

* System ID (a randomly generated, universally unique identifier (UUID)).
* {page-component-title} release.
* {page-component-title} version.
* OS architecture.
* OS name.
* OS version.
* Number of available processors (CPU).
* Amount of free physical memory.
* Total amount of physical memory.
* Number of alarms in the `alarms` table.
* Number of situations in the `alarms` table.
* Number of events in the `events` table.
* Number of IP interfaces in the `ipinterface` table.
* Number of nodes in the `node` table.
* Number of nodes, grouped by system OID.
