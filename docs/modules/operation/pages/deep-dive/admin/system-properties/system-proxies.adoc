= Configure System Proxies

You can enable system proxy settings with certain {page-component-title} components by setting the `use-system-proxy` or `useSystemProxy` parameters to `true`.
To configure system proxy servers, set some or all of the following properties:

[options="autowidth"]
|===
| Property  | Description   | Default Value

| http.proxyHost
| Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to use for plain HTTP requests.
| None

| http.proxyPort
| TCP port of the proxy server to use for plain HTTP requests.
| 3128

| https.proxyHost
| Hostname or IP address of the proxy server to use for HTTPS requests.
| None

| https.proxyPort
| TCP port of the proxy server to use for HTTPS requests.
| 3128

| http.nonProxyHosts
| Pipe-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses which bypass HTTP proxying.
| None

| https.nonProxyHosts
| Pipe-separated list of hostnames or IP addresses which bypass HTTPS proxying.
| None
|===

Depending on the JVM in use, the properties `http.proxyUser`, `http.proxyPassword`, and their `https.*` equivalents may enable the use of proxy servers that require authentication.

WARNING: Setting these properties may have unintended effects.
Use them with caution.
