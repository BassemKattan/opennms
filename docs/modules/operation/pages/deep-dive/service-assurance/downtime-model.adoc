= Downtime Model

By default the monitoring interval for a service is five minutes.
To detect short service outages, caused, for example, by automatic network rerouting, use the downtime model.
On a detected-service outage, the interval is reduced to every 30 seconds for five minutes.
If the service comes back within five minutes, a shorter outage is documented and the impact on service availability can be less than five minutes.
This configurable behavior is called "downtime model".

fix this: downtime model defines ...

The following figure shows two outages.
The first shows a short outage that was detected as up after 90 seconds.
The second outage is not currently resolved and the monitor has not detected an available service and was not available in the first five minutes (10 times 30 second polling).

The scheduler changed the polling interval back to five minutes.

----
<downtime interval="30000" begin="0" end="300000" /><!-- 30s, 0, 5m --><1>
<downtime interval="300000" begin="300000" end="43200000" /><!-- 5m, 5m, 12h --><2>
<downtime interval="600000" begin="43200000" end="432000000" /><!-- 10m, 12h, 5d --><3>
<downtime interval="3600000" begin="432000000" delete="never"/><!-- 1h, 5d --><4>
----
<1> From 0 seconds after an outage is detected until five minutes, set the polling interval to 30 seconds.
<2> After five minutes of an ongoing outage until 12 hours, set the polling interval to 5 minutes.
<3> Sfter 12 hours of an ongoing outage until five days, set the polling interval to 10 minutes.
<4> After five days of an ongoing outage the service will be polled only once a hour and we do not delete services.

The last downtime interval can have an attribute `delete` and lets you influence the service lifecycle.
It defines the behavior that happens if a service doesn't come back online after the specified interval.
The following downtime attributes for `delete` can be used:

[options="header, autowidth"]
[cols="1,3"]
