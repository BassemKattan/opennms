= Threshold creation

For information on how to create a basic or expression-based threshold, see <<quickstart/thresholding.adoc, Set up a threshold>> in the Quick Start section.

This section describes related thresholding tasks. 

[[ga-threshold-metadata]]
== Use metadata in a threshold

Metadata in expression-based thresholds can streamline threshold creation.
The <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, Metadata DSL>> (domain specific language) lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.
A single expression can behave differently based on the node being tested against.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata
* Service metadata

Metadata is also supported in value, re-arm, and trigger fields for Single-DS and expression-based thresholds.

NOTE: For more information on metadata and how to define it, see <<deep-dive/meta-data.adoc#metadata-overview, Metadata>>.

=== Example

This procedure uses metadata to trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds 1.

The expression is in the form `${context:key|context_fallback:key_fallback|...|default}`.

Before using metadata in a threshold, you need to add the metadata context pair, in this case, a requisition key called userLimit (see <deep-dive/<meta-data.adoc#ga-metadata-webui, Adding metadata through the web UI>>).

. Click the gear icon in the top-right menu.
. Under *Performance Measurement*, choose *Configure Thresholds*.
. Click *Edit* beside the *netsnmp* group.
. Click *Create New Expression-based Threshold*.
. Fill in the following information:

+
* Type: High
* Expression: `hrSystemNumUsers / ${requisition:userLimit|1}`
* Datasource type: Node
* Value: 1
* Rearm: 1
* Description: Too many logged-in users

. Click *Save*.

This expression will trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds 1.

[[metric-collect]]
== Determine that you are collecting the metric
Before creating a threshold, you need to make sure you are collecting the metric against which you want to threshold.

. In the {page-component-title} UI, choose menu:[Reports]Resource Graphs.
. Select one of the listed resources.
. Under *SNMP Node Data*, select *Node-level Performance Data* and choose *Graph Selection*.
. Scroll to find the *Number of Users* graph.
.. You can click the binoculars icon to display only this graph.

[[datasource-determine]]
== Determine the Data Source
Creating a threshold requires the name of the data source generating the metrics on which you want to threshold.
Data source names for the SNMP protocol appear in `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/`.

. To determine the name of the data source, navigate to the *Resource Graphs* screen.
For example,
.. *Reports>Resource Graphs*.
.. Select one of the listed resources.
.. Under *SNMP Node Data*, select *Node-level Performance Data* and choose *Graph Selection*.
. Scroll through the graphs to find the title of the graph that displays the metric on which you want to threshold.
For example, "Number of Processes" or "System Uptime":
+
image::thresholding/Graphs.png[]

. Go to `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/` and search for the title of the graph (for example, "System Uptime").

. Note the name of the data source, and type it in the *Datasource* field when you xref:quick-start/thresholding.adoc[create your threshold].
