[[metric-collect]]
=== Determine that you are collecting the metric
In this case, we have chosen a metric (number of logged-in users) that is collected by default.
We are also using data collected via SNMP. (For information on other collectors, see <<deep-dive/performance-data-collection/collectors.adoc#collectors-overview,Collectors>>.)

. In the {page-component-title} UI, choose *Reports>Resource Graphs*.
. Select one of the listed resources.
. Under *SNMP Node Data*, select *Node-level Performance Data* and choose *Graph Selection*.
. Scroll to find the *Number of Users* graph.
.. You can click the binoculars icon to display only this graph.

[[datasource-determine]]
= Determine the Data Source
Creating a threshold requires the name of the data source generating the metrics on which you want to threshold.
Data source names for the SNMP protocol appear in `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/`.

. To determine the name of the data source, navigate to the *Resource Graphs* screen.
For example,
.. *Reports>Resource Graphs*.
.. Select one of the listed resources.
.. Under *SNMP Node Data*, select *Node-level Performance Data* and choose *Graph Selection*.
. Scroll through the graphs to find the title of the graph that displays the metric on which you want to threshold.
For example, "Number of Processes" or "System Uptime":

. Go to `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/` and search for the title of the graph (for example, "System Uptime").

. Note the name of the data source, and type it in the *Datasource* field when you xref:deep-dive/thresholds/create-thresh.adoc#threshold-create[create your threshold].
