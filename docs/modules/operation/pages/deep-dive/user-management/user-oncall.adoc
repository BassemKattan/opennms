= On-Call Roles

On-Call Roles let you assign a predefined xref:deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc#ga-user-schedule[duty schedule] to an existing Group of users.
A common use case is to have System Engineers in on-call rotations with a defined schedule.

For each On-Call Role, a user is designated as a Supervisor.
They are responsible for the group of people assigned to the On-Call Role, and receive {page-component-title} notifications when no one else is on duty.
The Supervisor must have admin privileges.
