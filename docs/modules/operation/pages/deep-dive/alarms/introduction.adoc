{page-component-title} monitors problem states with its managed entities, their resources, the services they provide, and any applications that they host.
Simply stated, {page-component-title} uses the network to monitor problem states.

While events (or messages) carry problem state attributes, such as acknowledgement and severity, alarms are the indicators of problems in the network (see )

{page-component-title} monitors the state of problems with its managed entities (ME), their resources, the services they provide, as well as the applications they host; or more simply, the network.
{page-component-title}, characterizes the state of these problems as alarms.

While OpenNMS events (or messages) carry problem state attributes such as acknowledgement and severity, alarms are _the_ indicator for problems in the network (see xref:deep-dive/bsm/introduction.adoc[]).

== Single alarm tracking problem states

An alarm is instantiated on the first occurrence of a `service-down` problem:

.`service-down` alarm created
image::alarms/single_alarm_1.png["Alarm List displaying one alarm of Minor severity", 800]

You can click *Count* to display the corresponding events and their details:

.Alarm displaying service down event
image::alarms/single_alarm_2.png["Alarm Details page displaying a service down event", 800]

The alarm is cleared immediately when service is restored, and no alarm is created when the service returns to a normal state:

.Alarm cleared
image::alarms/single_alarm_3.png["Alarm List displaying one cleared alarm and its log message", 800]

.Service down and service restored events
image::alarms/single_alarm_4.png["Alarm Details page displaying one service down event and one service restored event", 800]

If the problem occurs again, the events are reduced into the existing alarm.
Its Count is updated to reflect the new activity:

.Reduced alarm
image::alarms/single_alarm_5.png["Alarm List displaying one alarm with a Count of 2", 800]

.List of events
image::alarms/single_alarm_6.png["Alarm Details page displaying two service down events and one service restored event", 800]

The alarm is once again cleared immediately when service is restored:

.Reduced alarm cleared
image::alarms/single_alarm_7.png["Alarm List displaying one cleared alarm with a Count of 2, and its log message", 800]

Note that the alarm's Count does not increment when the problem is resolved.

.Service down and restored events
