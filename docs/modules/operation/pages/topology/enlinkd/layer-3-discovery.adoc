= Layer 3 Link Discovery

Using enlinkd, it is possible to get links based on data from network routing applications.
The following routing daemons can be used to provide links-based layer 3 information:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First] (OSPF)
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IS-IS[Intermediate System to Intermediate System] (IS-IS)

Information on level 2 network links is provided by SNMP agents that support the appropriate MIBs.
For this reason, you are required to have a working SNMP configuration.
The link data that is discovered by enlinkd is detailed in the topology user interface, and on a node's Details page.
