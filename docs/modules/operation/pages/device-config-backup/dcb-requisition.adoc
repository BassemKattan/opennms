= Create Requisition for Device Configuration Backup

After you have xref:operation:device-config-backup/ssh.adoc#backup-script[created a backup script for each device type] and xref:operation:device-config-backup/configuration.adoc#poller-config[configured the TFTP port], you can create a requisition for each device whose configuration you want to back up.

To activate the device configuration backup, you must add metadata that defines the device configuration backup script you created for the node's device type, and the device's username and password.

. Log in to OpenNMS and click the gears icon.
. Choose *Provisioning>Manage Provisioning Requisitions*.
. Click *Add Requisition* and enter a name for the requisition.
If you want to enable device config backup on existing nodes in a requisition, select the desired requisition and edit the node definition.
. Click on the edit icon and click *Add Node*.
. Set up your requisition as described in xref:operation:provisioning/getting-started.adoc#requisition-create[Create a requisition].
. Click *Add Meta-Data*, and define the following key-value pairs:
.. `dcbusername`: username for the device
.. `dcbpassword`: password for the device
.. `script-file`: name of the device configuration script for this type of device
. Click *Save* to save the metadata and then *Save* to save the requisition.

== Run a device configuration backup
Since no device configuration back ups will appear in the UI until one runs, we recommend that you run a requisition immediately.

. Choose the requisition to run, and click *Synchronize*.
. Select a scan option and click *Synchronize*.

Go to *Info>Configuration Management* to view the device configuration backup.

See xref:operation:device-config-backup/dcb.adoc#dcb-manage[manage device configuration backup UI] for more information.
