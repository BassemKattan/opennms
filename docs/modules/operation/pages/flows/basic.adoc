= Basic flows setup

This section describes how to get started with flows, in a basic set up to collect, enrich (classify), persist, and visualize flows.

== Before you begin

Make sure you have configured your routers to send flows.
Refer to the manufacturer's documentation.
You will need to set up the flow receiver, which is OpenNMS {page-component-title}, and enable sending flows per interface on the firewall.
