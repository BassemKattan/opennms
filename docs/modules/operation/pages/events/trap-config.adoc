In addition to internally generated events, OpenNMS can also receive SNMP traps via the trapd process.
OpenNMS uses the `mask` tag to match SNMP traps in `eventconf.xml`.

== Create event definitions from trap definitions in SNMP MIBs

You can parse SNMP MIB definitions and create OpenNMS event definitions from any `TRAP-TYPE` and/or `NOTIFICATION-TYPE` macros they contain through the UI.

Choose the gears icon and SNMP MIB Compiler.

Two command-line utilities, ''mib2events'' and ''mib2opennms'', are also available to do the heavy lifting of making event definitions from MIB definitions. The GUI editor does at least as good a job as ''mib2events''. Only masochists should be using ''mib2opennms'' nowadays; it tends to produce more bus errors than event definitions.
