== Create event definitions from MIB files

Create event definitions from trap definitions in SNMP MIBs

You can parse SNMP MIB definitions and create OpenNMS event definitions from any `TRAP-TYPE` and/or `NOTIFICATION-TYPE` macros they contain through the UI.

Choose the gears icon and SNMP MIB Compiler.

Two command-line utilities, ''mib2events'' and ''mib2opennms'', are also available to do the heavy lifting of making event definitions from MIB definitions.
The GUI editor does at least as good a job as ''mib2events''.
Only masochists should be using ''mib2opennms'' nowadays; it tends to produce more bus errors than event definitions.
