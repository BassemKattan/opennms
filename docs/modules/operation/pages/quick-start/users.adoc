= Step 1: Login and change admin password

This section describes the first-time login to OpenNMS {page-component-title}, how to change the admin password, and how to create a user.

For additional information and procedures on user management, including user groups, user configuration, and security roles, see xref:deep-dive/user-management/introduction.adoc[User Management] in the Deep Dive section.

== First-time login and data choices

Access the {page-component-title} web application at \http://<ip-or-fqdn-of-your-server>:8980/opennms.

The default user login is `admin` with the password `admin`.

The first time you log in we prompt for permission to allow the `Data Choices` module to collect and publish anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.

The OpenNMS Group uses this anonymized information to help determine product usage and to improve the {page-component-title} software.
We do not share it with third parties.

Click *Show me what is being sent* to see what xref:admin/housekeeping/introduction.adoc#ga-data-collection[information we collect].
Statistics collection and publication happen only if an admin user opts in.

NOTE: Admin users can xref:admin/housekeeping/introduction.adoc#disable-data-collection[enable or disable usage statistics collection] at any time.

== Admin User Setup

After logging in for the first time, make sure to change the default admin user password to a secure one:

. Click the gear icon in the top right.
. Choose *Configure OpenNMS -> Configure Users, Groups and On-Call roles* and select *Configure Users*.
. Click *Modify* beside the admin user.
. In the *User Password* area, click *Reset Password*, update the password and click *OK*.
. Click *Finish* at the bottom of the Modify User screen to save changes.

WARNING: Note that you cannot use angle brackets (<>), single (') and double quotation marks ("), and the ampersand symbol (&) in the user ID.

We recommend that you do not use the default `admin` user, but instead xref:deep-dive/user-management/user-config.adoc#ga-user-config [create specific users] with the admin role and/or other permissions.
This helps to keep track of who has performed tasks such as clearing alarms or creating notifications.

WARNING: Do not delete the default `admin` and `rtc` users.
The `rtc` user is used for the communication of the Real-Time Console on the start page to calculate the node and service availability.
