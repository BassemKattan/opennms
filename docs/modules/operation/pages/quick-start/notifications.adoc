= Step 2: Turn on Default Notifications

This section describes how to turn on default notifications in {page-component-title}.

{page-component-title} uses notifications to inform users about events in the network without requiring them to log in to the web UI.
Notifications are commonly sent through email and text/pager messages, but can be customized to send to a variety of external systems.
For additional information, including alternative notification mechanisms, see xref:operation:deep-dive/notifications/introduction.adoc[Notifications] in the Deep Dive section and the xref:reference:daemons/daemon-config-files/notifd.adoc[notifd daemon] reference section.

== Enable notifications

Notifications are disabled by default in a fresh {page-component-title} installation.
Follow these steps to enable notifications:

. Log in as a user with admin privileges.
. Click the *Gear* icon in the top-right of the screen.
. Under Event Management, click *On* beside Notification Status, and click *Update*.

The green bell icon at the top of the screen indicates that notifications are enabled globally.

NOTE: The workflow above is functionally equivalent to editing `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/notifd-configuration.xml` and setting `status="on"` in the top-level `notifd-configuration` element.
This configuration file update happens immediately, with no need to restart {page-component-title}.

== Configure destination paths

A destination path specifies the "who" (recipient), "when" (delay), and "how" (method) of a notification.
It also specifies escalation targets.
Configuring destination paths separately from individual events lets you use the same information for multiple notifications.
This minimizes duplication and encourages reuse.

Follow these steps to configure a destination path:

. Log in as a user with admin privileges.
. Click the *Gear* icon in the top-right of the screen, and choose menu:Event Management[Configure Notifications > Configure Destination Paths].
. Click *New Path*, fill in the desired information, and click *Finish*.
** To add an existing destination path, select it from the list in the *Destinations Path* screen, and click *Edit*.

It is possible to define multiple notifications for the same unique event identifier (UEI) to use different destination paths.
By default, {page-component-title} runs the destination path of all notifications matching the event's UEI.
You can configure notifd to process only the destination path of the first matching notification by editing `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/notifd-configuration.xml` and setting `match-all="false"` in the top-level `notifd-configuration` element.

NOTE: Configuration of destination paths is stored in `$\{OPENNMS_HOME}/etc/destinationPaths.xml`.
Changes to this file happen immediately, with no need to restart {page-component-title}.
