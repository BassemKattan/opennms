= Quick Start

The Quick Start guide assumes you have already completed the deployment steps, have installed a xref:deployment:core/introduction.adoc[{page-component-title} instance], and are able to connect to the web UI at `\http://<ip-or-fqdn-of-your-server>:8980/opennms`.

Unless otherwise stated, the procedures in the Quick Start require you to be logged in to the OpenNMS web UI as a user with Admin privileges.
<<quick-start/users.adoc, Step 1: First-Time Login>> describes how to create an admin user.
