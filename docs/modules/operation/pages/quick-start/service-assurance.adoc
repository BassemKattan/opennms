= Step 7: Determine Service Availability

By default, {page-component-title} monitors a number of services including ICMP, DNS, Elasticsearch, SMTP, FTP, SNMP, HTTP(S), SSH, Postgres, IMAP, POP3, and so on.
Using a service monitor framework with pollerd as the main component, {page-component-title} detects if a service is available, then monitors it for its availability and response time.
Calculated over the last 24 hours, you can view this availability information in summary on the main dashboard, or on a per-node basis.

Pollerd schedules and runs service monitors, as specified in `poller-configuration.xml`.
When a service monitor detects an outage, pollerd sends an event which {page-componenent-title} uses to create an alarm.
You can also use events to generate a notification for on-call network or server administrators.
