# Geographical Maps

OpenNMS includes a geographical map which can show nodes with address asset information on a world map, including dynamic alarm status.

The geographical map is located in the `Maps` menu or by going to the page of a node that has an address and/or longitude/latitude defined in its asset fields, and following the `View in Geographical Map` link.

## Markers and Clusters

The geographical map displays each node that has an associated longitude and latitude in the database. 
If a node does not have coordinates recorded, update the requisition to include address asset fields and verify the xref:admin/geocoder.adoc[geocoder service] is configured and enabled.

The geographical map automatically clusters nodes into groups if they are close together. 
A marker with a number in it indicates a cluster and the number of nodes in in it.
Hover over a cluster to show the contents of the nodes it contains. 
Click on a marker to show the summary of the nodes it contains.

## Status

A node's marker displays as the color associated with the most severe alarm for that node. 
A cluster's marker displays as the color of the highest severity of the nodes the marker contains.
