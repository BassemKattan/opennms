# Geographical Maps

OpenNMS includes a geographical map which can show nodes with address asset information on a world map, including dynamic alarm status.

The geographical map is located in the `Maps` menu or by going to the page of a node that has an address and/or longitude/latitude defined in its asset fields, and following the `View in Geographical Map` link.

## Markers and Clusters

The geographical maps display each node that has an address, or longitude and latitude in the database. When the geographical map is loaded, it will look at each node. If the node has coordinates, it will display it on the map. If the node has an address, it will use a geolocation service to convert the address to coordinates, and then display it on the map.

The geographical map automatically clusters nodes into groups if they are close together. 
A marker with a number in it indicates a cluster and the number of nodes in in it.
Hover over a cluster to show the boundaries of the nodes it contains. 
Click on a marker to show the summary of the nodes it contains.

## Status

A node's marker displays as the color associated with the most severe alarm for that node. 
A cluster's marker displays as the color of the highest severity of the nodes the marker contains.
