= Detectors

Detectors can be used within the provisioning process to detect available services on nodes automatically.

[[ga-provisioning-meta-data]]
== Metadata DSL
Service detectors can use <<meta-data.adoc#ga-meta-data-dsl, MetaData DSL>> (domain specific language) to leverage dynamic configuration in parameter values to interpolate metadata into the parameter.

The syntax lets you use patterns in an expression, whereby the metadata is replaced with a corresponding value during the collection process.

During evaluation of an expression, the following scopes are available:

* Node metadata
* Interface metadata


== Supported detectors

The supported detectors can be found in xref:reference:provisioning/detectors[provisioning detectors reference section].
