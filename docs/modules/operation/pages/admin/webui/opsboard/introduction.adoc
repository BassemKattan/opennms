= Operator Board

In a network operation center (NOC) you can use the ops board to visualize monitoring information.
The monitoring information for various use cases are arranged in configurable dashlets.
To address different user groups it is possible to create multiple ops boards.

There are two visualization components to display dashlets:

 * Ops Panel: Shows multiple dashlets on one screen (for example, on a NOC operator's workstation)
 * Ops Board: Shows one dashlet at a time in rotation (for example, for a screen wall in a NOC)
