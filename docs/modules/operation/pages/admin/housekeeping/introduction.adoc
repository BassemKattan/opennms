= Housekeeping Tasks

There are a number of housekeeping tasks you may want to do regularly to ensure optimum system performance.
We also recommend you complete these housekeeping tasks before upgrading {page-component-title}.

== Delete cache folder
Run the Fix Karaf script to delete cached items so that your system is cleaned up, especially before upgrade.


== Run a diff on configuration files
Run the config diff command in the /bin directory to identify differences from the default configuration to what you have running.
Identifying these differences allow you to make a better guess on what you need to merge as part of an upgrade.

== Update permissions (if upgrading from pre-29 versions)

== Delete older events

== Assess event table size
