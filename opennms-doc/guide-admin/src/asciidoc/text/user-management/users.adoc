=== First Time Login and Data Choices

Access the {opennms-product-name} web application at http://<ip-or-fqdn-of-your-server>:8980/opennms.

The default user login is `admin` with the password `admin`.

The first time you log in we prompt for permission to allow the `Data Choices` module to collect and publish anonymous usage statistics to https://stats.opennms.org.

The OpenNMS Group uses this information to help determine product usage and to improve the {opennms-product-name} software.

Click *Show me what is being sent* to see what xref:ga-data-collection[information we collect]. 
Statisitcs collection and publication happen only if an admin user opts in.

NOTE: Admin users can enable or disable usage statistics collection at any time by choosing *admin>Configure OpenNMS>Additional Tools>Data Choices* and selecting *Opt-in* or *Opt-out* in the UI.

*Data Collection*

When enabled, the `Data Choices` module collects the following anonymous statistics and publishes them on system startup and every 24 hours after:

* System ID (a randomly generated universally unique identifier (UUID))
* {opennms-product-name} Release
* {opennms-product-name} Version
* OS Architecture
* OS Name
* OS Version
* Number of alarms in the `alarms` table
* Number of events in the `events` table
* Number of IP interfaces in the `ipinterface` table
* Number of nodes in the `node` table
* Number of nodes, grouped by System OID

==== Admin User Setup

After logging in for the first time, make sure to change the default admin user password to a secure one: 

. Go to *admin>Configure OpenNMS>Configure Users, Groups and On-Call Roles>Configure Users*.
. Click *Modify* beside the admin user.
. In the *User Password* area, click *Reset Password*, update your password and click *OK*.
. Click *Finish* at the bottom of the Modify User screen to save changes. 

We recommend not using the default `admin` user, but instead xref:user-config.adoc[creating specific users] with the admin role and/or other permissions. 
This helps keep to track of who has done tasks such as clearing alarms or creating notifications. 

WARNING: Do not delete the default _admin_ and _rtc_ users.
         The _rtc_ user is used for the communication of the Real-Time Console on the start page to calculate the node and service availability.
