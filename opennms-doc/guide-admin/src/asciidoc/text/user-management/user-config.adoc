=== User Creation and Configuration

Only a user with admin privileges can create users and assign security roles to them. 
We recommend creating a new admin user instead of using the default. 

Ideally, each user account corresponds to a person, to help track who performs tasks in your {opennms-product-name} system.
Assigning different xref:security-roles.adoc#[security roles] to each user helps restrict what tasks the user can perform. 

In addition to local users, you can configure external authentication services including link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Spring_Security_and_LDAP[LDAP / LDAPS], link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Spring_Security_and_Radius[RADIUS], and link:https://wiki.opennms.org/wiki/Single_Sign_On[SSO].
Configuration specifics for these services are outside the scope of this documentation.

WARNING: Do not delete the default _admin_ and _rtc_ users.
         The _rtc_ user is used for the communication of the Real-Time Console on the start page to calculate the node and service availability.

==== Create User Duty Schedule

A duty schedule specifies the days and times a user (or group)receives notifications, on a per-week basis. 


This feature allows you to customize a schedule based on your team's hours of operation.  
 #TODO: determine how the additional schedules work#

If a notification should be delivered to an individual user, but that user is not on duty at the time, the notification will never be delivered to that user.
In the case of notifications targeting a user via a group, the logic differs slightly.
If the group is on duty at the time the notification is created, then all users who are also on duty will be notified.
If the group is on duty, but no member user is currently on duty, then the notification will be queued and sent to the next user who comes on duty.
If the group is off duty at the time the notification is created, then the notification will never be sent.

To add a duty schedule for a user (or group), follow these steps:
. Login as a user with administrative permissions.
. Choose *admin>Configure OpenNMS* from the top-right menu. 
. Choose *Configure Users, Groups and On-Call roles* and select *Configure Users* (*Configure Groups*).
. Choose the user (or group) you want to modify. 
. In the *Duty Schedule* area, click *Add Schedule*. 
. Specify the days and times during which you want the user (or group) to receive notifications.
