=== Provisioning Single Nodes (Quick-Add Node)

The Quick-Add Node feature allows you to add a single node to an existing provisioning requisition, and set the community string at the same time the node is provisioned.  

When you configure an individual IP address within an existing range, {opennms-product-name} will split the range into two, and add a specific entry for the IP address. See xref:xml-samples.adoc#quick-add-xml[Quick-Add Node Configuration] for the resulting XML configuration.

To use the Quick-Add Node feature, follow these steps:

. Make sure you have created a provisioning group. 
Log in to the web UI and click the *+* sign.
.

. Create a foreign source (if required)
. Specify SNMP configuration
. Provide a single node with the following specification
