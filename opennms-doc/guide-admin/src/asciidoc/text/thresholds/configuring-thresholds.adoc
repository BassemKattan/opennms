=== Configuring Thresholds

Configuration of a threshold requires editing two main XML entities: <threshd-configuration/> and <thresholding-config/>.


In Horizon 24.0.0, a two new attributes were added to the <threshd-configuration/> that directs the thresholders to continue to send events informing the current value of a triggered threshold.
By default, these are not instantiated as Alarms.
The two new new optional configuration attributes for this feature.
* sustainedUEI
* send-sustained-events

The flag controlling this behavior, send-sustained-events, disabled by default.
The threshold sustained UEI is optional and a default is provided along with an event configuration for this UEI: uei.opennms.org/threshold/thresholdSustained.
