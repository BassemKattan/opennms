=== Threshold Notes
A new feature was introduced in Horizon 24.0.0 that allows users to enable generating subsequent events each time an active threshold is measured and is still meeting the triggering value.
By default, this new event has one of the following UEI's:

* uei.opennms.org/threshold/highThresholdSustained
* uei.opennms.org/threshold/lowThresholdSustained

This new event has all the same parameters as the triggering events:

* uei.opennms.org/threshold/highThresholdExceeded
* uei.opennms.org/threshold/lowThresholdExceeded

Like the other default threshold UEIs, the sustained UEI can be changed to a custom UEI.
