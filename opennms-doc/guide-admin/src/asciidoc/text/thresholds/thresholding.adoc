= Thresholding

Thresholding allows you to define limits against network performance metrics of a managed entity to trigger an event when a value goes above or below the specified limit. 

_{opennms-product-name}_ uses four thresholding algorithms that trigger an event when the datasource value:

* *Low* - equals or drops below the threshold value and re-arms when it equals or comes back up above the re-arm value (e.g., available disk space falls under the specified value)
* *High* - equals or exceeds the threshold value, and re-arms when it equals or drops below the re-arm value (e.g., bandwidth use exceeds the specified amount)
* *Absolute* - changes by the specified amount (e.g., on a fiber-optic link, a change in loss of anything greater than 3 dB is a problem regardless of what the original or final value is)
* *Relative* - changes by percent (e.g., available disk space changes more than 5% from the last poll)

These thresholds can be *basic* (tested against a single value) or an *expression* (evaluated against multiple values in an expression). 
You can also create notifications for threshold events #TODO: insert cross-reference#. 

_{opennms-product-name}_ applies these algorithms against any performance data (telemetry) collected by <<ga-performance-mgmt,collectd>> or pushed to <<ga-telemetryd, telemetryd>>. #TODO: is this information too technical?#
This includes, but is not limited to metrics such as CPU load, bandwidth, disk space, etc. #do we need to list protocols?

=== Basic Walk-through â€“ Thresholding

This section describes how to create a basic threshold for a single, system-wide variable: the number of logged-in users. 
Our threshold will tell OpenNMS to create an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds two, and re-arm when it falls below two. 

Before creating a threshold, you need to make sure you are collecting the metric against which you want to threshold. 

[[metric-collect]]
==== Determine You are Collecting Metric
In this case, we have chosen a metric (number of logged-in users) that is collected by default. 
We are also using data collected via SNMP. (For information on other collectors, see .)

. In OpenNMS, choose `Reports>Resource Graphs`.
. Select one of the listed resources. [how do they know which to choose?]
. Under `SNMP Node Data`, select `Node-level Performance Data` and choose `Graph Selection`.
. Scroll to find the `Number of Users` graph. 
.. You can click the binoculars icon to display only this graph. 

TIP: If you are not collecting this metric, see xref?? for information. 

[[threshold-create]]
==== Create a Threshold

. Select `<User_Name>>Configure OpenNMS` from the top-right menu. 
. Under `Performance Measurement`, choose `Configure Thresholds`.
.. A screen with a list of preconfigured threshold groups appears.
We will work with `netsnmp`.
For information on how to create a threshold group, see <<threshold-group, Creating a threshold group>>. 
. Click `Edit` beside the `netsnmp` group. 
. Click `Create New Threshold` at the bottom of the `Basic Thresholds` area of the screen. 
. Set the following information and click `Save`:

|===

| *Field* | *Value* | *Description*

| Type | high | Triggers an event when the datasource value equals or exceeds the threshold value, and re-arms when it equals or drops below the re-arm value

| Datasource | hrSystemNumUsers| Name of the datasource you want to threshold against.
For this tutorial, we have provided the datasource for logged-in users.  

For information on how to determine a metric's datasource, see <<datasource-determine, Determine the Datasource>>

| Datasource label| leave blank | Optional text label. 
Not required for this tutorial.

| Value| 2 | The value above which we want to trigger an event. 
In this case, we want to trigger an event when the number of logged-in users exceeds two. 

| Re-arm | 2 | The value below which we want the system to re-arm. 
In this case, once the number of logged-in users falls below two. 

| Trigger | 3 | The number of consecutive times the threshold value can occur before the system triggers an event. 
Since our default polling period is 5 minutes, a value of 3 means OpenNMS 
would create a threshold event if there are more than 2 users for 15 minutes.

| Description | leave blank | Optional text to describe your threshold. 

| Triggered UEI| leave blank | A custom uniform event identifier (UEI) sent into the events system when the threshold is triggered. 
A custom UEI for each threshold makes it easier to <<threshold-notification, create notifications>>. 
If left blank, it defaults to the standard thresholds UEIs. 

| Re-armed UEI | leave blank | A custom uniform event identifier (UEI) sent into the events system when the threshold is re-armed.

=== Testing the Threshold

To test the threshold we just created, log a second person into OpenNMS. 
Navigate to the `Events` page.
You should see an event that indicates your threshold triggered, when more than one user logged in. 

Log out the second user. 
The `Events` page should indicate that the system has re-armed.

== Creating a Resource Filter for a Threshold
Resource filters allow you to define conditions where you apply or do not apply the threshold (e.g., you have a file system that is read only, it will always be at 100% utilization, so you don't necessarily want to trigger on it).
These filters can be as simple or as complex as required, by using and/or operators for multiple filters. 
Let's create a resource filter for #TODO: one of our previous procedures#.


== General Thresholding Tasks

This section will appear in an appendix on thresholding as reference procedures that are generic without specific examples. 

[[datasource-determine]]
=== Determining the Datasource
Creating a threshold requires the name of the datasource generating the metrics on which you want to threshold. 
Datasource names appear in `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/`.

. To determine the name of the datasource, navigate to the `Resource Graphs` screen.
For example,
.. `Reports>Resource Graphs`.
.. Select one of the listed resources.
.. Under `SNMP Node Data`, select `Node-level Performance Data` and choose `Graph Selection`.

. Scroll through the graphs to find the title of the graph that displays the metric on which you want to threshold. 
For example, "Number of Processes" or "System Uptime":
+
image::thresholding/graphs.png[Thresholding graph, 200]

. Go to `etc/snmp-graph.properties.d/` and search for the title of the graph (for example, "System Uptime"):

+
capture image 

. Note the name of the datasource, and enter it in the `Datasource` field when you <<threshold-create, create your threshold>>.  

NOTE: To determine a datasource from a different management protocol, ...


[[data-enable]]
==== Enable Data Collection

[[threshold-pkg]]
==== Specify Nodes/Interfaces for Threshold

[[threshold-service]]
==== Create a Service Definition

[[threshold-group]]
==== Create a Threshold Group
A threshold group associates a set of thresholds to a service (e.g., thresholds that apply to all Cisco devices). 
_{opennms-product-name}_ includes seven preconfigured, editable threshold groups:

* mib2 
* cisco 
* hrstorage 
* netsnmp 
* juniper-srx 
* netsnmp-memory-linux 
* netsnmp-memory-nonlinux 

You can edit an existing group (through the UI) or create a new one (in the _thresholds.xml_ file located in `$OPENNMS_HOME/etc/thresholds.xml`). 
Once you create the group, you can then define it in the _thresholds.xml_ file or define it in the UI. 

We will create a threshold group called "demo_group". [better name?]

. Type the following in the _thresholds.xml_ file.

+
[source]
----

<group name="demo_group" rrdRepository="/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp/">
</group>

----

. Once you have created the group in the _thresholds.xml_ file, switch to the UI, go to the threshold screen and click `Request a reload threshold packages configuration`.

.. The group you created should appear in the UI.

. Click `Edit` to edit it. 

 #TODO: add information, then show how it looks in the _thresholds.xml_ file#

The following is a sample of how the threshold appears in the _thresholds.xml_ file: #TODO: update and label#

[source]
----

<group name="demo_group" rrdRepository="/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp/">
  <expression type="high" ds-type="hrStorageIndex" value="90.0"
    rearm="75.0" trigger="2" ds-label="hrStorageDescr"
    filterOperator="or" expression="hrStorageUsed / hrStorageSize * 100.0">
    <resource-filter field="hrStorageType">^\.1\.3\.6\.1\.2\.1\.25\.2\.1\.4$</resource-filter>
  </expression>
</group>

[[threshold-notification]]
==== Create a Notification on a Threshold Event
A custom UEI for each threshold makes it easier to <<threshold-notification, create notifications>>. 

=== Thresholding Service

The Thresholding Service is the component responsible for maintaining the state of the performance metrics and for generating alarms from these when thresholds are triggered (armed) or cleared (unarmed).

The thresholding service listens for and visits performance metrics _after_ they are persisted to the time series database.

The state of the thresholds are held in memory and pushed to persistent storage only when they are changed.

==== Distributed Thresholding with Sentinel

Thresholding for streaming telemetry with <<ga-telemetryd, telemetryd>> is supported on Sentinel when using <<ga-opennms-operation-newts, Newts>>.
When running on Sentinel, the thresholding state can be stored in either Cassandra or PostgreSQL.
Given that Newts already requires Cassandra, we recommend using Casssandra in order to help minimize the load on PostgreSQL.

Thresholding on Sentinel uses the same configuration files as _{opennms-product-name}_ and operates similarly.
When a thresholding changes to/from trigger or cleared, and event is published which is processed by _{opennms-product-name}_ and the alarm is created or updated.

=== Shell Commands

The following shell commands are made available to help debug and manage thresholding.

Enumerate the persisted threshold states using `opennms-threshold-states:enumerate`:

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms-threshold-states:enumerate 
Index   State Key
1       23-127.0.0.1-hrStorageIndex-hrStorageUsed / hrStorageSize * 100.0-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-RELATIVE_CHANGE
2       23-127.0.0.1-if-ifHCInOctets * 8 / 1000000 / ifHighSpeed * 100-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-HIGH
3       23-127.0.0.1-node-((loadavg5 / 100) / CpuNumCpus) * 100.0-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-HIGH
4       23-127.0.0.1-if-ifInDiscards + ifOutDiscards-/opt/opennms/share/rrd/snmp-HIGH
----

Each state is uniquely identified by a `state key` and aliased by the given `index`.
Indexes are scoped to the particular shell session and provided as an alternative to specifying the complete state key in subsequent commands.

Display state details using `opennms-threshold-states:details`:

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms-threshold-states:details 1
multiplier=1.333
lastSample=64.77758166043765
previousTriggeringSample=28.862826722171075

admin@opennms> opennms-threshold-states:details 2
exceededCount=0
armed=true
interpolatedExpression='ifHCInOctets * 8 / 1000000 / ifHighSpeed * 100'
----

NOTE: Different types of thresholds will display different properties.

Clear a particular persisted state using `opennms-threshold-states:clear`:

[source]
----
admin@opennms> opennms-threshold-states:clear 2
----

Or clear all the persisted states with `opennms-threshold-states:clear-all`:
