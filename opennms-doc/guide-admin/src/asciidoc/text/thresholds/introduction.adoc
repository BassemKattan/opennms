[[ga-threshd-introduction]]
_{opennms-product-name}_ has the ability to monitor the performance of a managed entity's resource(s) by using various thresholding techniques.
These techniques, or algorithms, can be used applied against any metric data (telemetry) that has been gathered such as: CPU Load, Bandwidth, Disk space, etc. and, when triggered, causes Alarms to be generated.
There are a few basic thresholding algorithms available within OpenNMS:

* High
* Low
* Absolute Value
* Relative Change
